             <h1>Parrots</h1>
             <p>
                Parrots are vibrant, intelligent birds known for their striking
                plumage and ability to mimic sounds and human speech.
                They posses strong, curved beaks and zygodactyl feet
                , which help them to grasp objects and climb with ease.
                Parrots are social creatures, often forming strong bonds with
                their mates and requiring plenty if interactionand mental
                simulation. In the wild, they can be found in the tropical
                and subtropical regions, where they live in flocks and feed in fruits, nuts
                and seeds.
